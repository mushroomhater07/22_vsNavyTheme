# Shalev's Dark theme

## Screenshot
* I have to figure it out!!

## The most productive theme
*    In VS Code, open the Color Theme picker with File > Preferences > Color Theme. (Code > Preferences > Color Theme on macOS).
*    You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+K Ctrl+T to display the picker.
*    Choose "Shalev Dark"
*    Click or press Enter
